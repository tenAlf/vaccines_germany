# Vaccines by county in Germany
This project is mainly considered as a excercise in the usage of git (and GitHub), Rstudio and possibly developing a shiny App.
Based on the vaccination data published by the RKI this project will focus on creating a visualization of the development of 
vaccinations administered on county level.
